/**
 * A thread-safe queue that allows concurrent modification of non-adjacent elements.
 */
class ConcurrentFifo<T> implements Fifo<T>, Fifa<T> {
    /*
     * This class relies on consistent lock ordering. Locks are ALWAYS obtained
     * in the order of elements in the queue. The locks used are the monitors
     * of the node elements, and each node's monitor guards the relationship
     * between that node and its successor. By implication, it guards the other
     * node's back reference as well.
     *
     * So, for a delete operation, two nodes must be locked: the node to be
     * deleted, and the previous node, but NOT IN THAT ORDER! Moreover, after
     * the previous node is locked, the relationship must be checked to ensure
     * it is still current. The convention observed is that next() is only
     * accessed while the lock is held, and it is cross-checked against any
     * unguarded calls to prev().
     *
     * NOTE: this is not double-check locking (DCL) because the early access
     * never obviates a synchronized block, and results are always checked 
     * within the guarded section. Therefore, it is not necessary for any of
     * the non-final fields to be volatile.
     * 
     * DCL: https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/jsr-133-faq.html#dcl
     *
     * If inconsistency is detected, all locks are to be released and the
     * operation restarted from scratch, unless it can be determined the
     * operation has definitively failed due to concurrent modification.
     *
     * Operations on non-adjacent nodes are concurrent. Concurrent operations
     * on a node or on adjacent nodes will contend for monitors, but never
     * deadlock.
